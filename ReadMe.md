# üèõÔ∏è University System Management

This project is a **University Management System** built in **C++**. It allows users to manage and manipulate data about professors, students, courses, and semesters. The system offers functionalities such as adding, modifying, and deleting records, assigning professors to courses, enrolling students, tracking student performance, and more. 

## Features

- **Manage Professors**: Add, modify, or delete professor records.
- **Manage Students**: Add, modify, or delete student records.
- **Course Management**: Add, modify, or delete courses in the system.
- **Enroll Students in Courses**: Assign students to the appropriate courses.

- **Student Progress**: View students who have passed specific courses.
- **Semester Management**: Advance semesters and manage the academic calendar.
- **Student Grades**: View and manage student grades for each course.
- **Graduation Eligibility**: Check which students are eligible for graduation based on their grades and course progress.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Print detailed reports about students, professors, and courses in the system.

## Data Management

- The system loads data from files such as `students.txt`, `professors.txt`, and `courses.txt` to initialize the records.
- Data can be added or modified through the menu options, and the system will update the respective files.
